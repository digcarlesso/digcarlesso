Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer with 9+ years of experience. I’m a quick learner and for the most part self-taught, always studying new technologies. I have great experience with web applications, focused now in C#, Reactand JavaScript.

- 💼 I’m currently working as a back-end developer
- 💻 Full Stack developer, still not sure what to focus on (back or front) 🤔
- 🌱 Focusing on back-end development (.Net, C#), because of my work
- 🎮 Gamer
