Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer with 9+ years of experience. I’m a quick learner and for the most part self-taught, always studying new technologies. I have great experience with web applications, focused now in React, JavaScript and C#.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a full stack developer
- 🌱 I’m focusing on front-end development (React, JavaScript, TypeScript and CSS)
